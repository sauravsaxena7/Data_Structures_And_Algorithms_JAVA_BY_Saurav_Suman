REMOVED RMI ACTIVATION (STANDARD:
WHAT: Officially removes the outdated RMI activation API
      for distributed object management.

WHY: Encourage the use of more modern and efficient alternatives
     like JNDI or Spring remoting

HOW IT WORKS:

RMI activation APIS are no longer available in Java 17.
Developers should migrate their existing code to use
alternative approaches for distributed object management.
