HIDDEN Classes (Standard):

WHAT: Make internal JDK classes invisible to the
      reflection API for enhanced security.

WHY: Prevent accidental access and manipulation of
     sensitive internal implementations details.

HOW IT WORKS:
 Internal classes are marked as internal and not accessible
 through reflection.
 This protects against potential security vulnerabilities
 and improve code stability.

 NOTE: This feature mainly affects internal JDK functionality
       and has minimal impact on general Java development
