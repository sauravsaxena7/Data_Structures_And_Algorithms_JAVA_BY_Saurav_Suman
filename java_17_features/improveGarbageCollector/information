Improved Garbage Collector (Standard):
WHAT: Enhance garbage collection performance,
      particularly with the GIGC algorithm.


WHY: Reduce memory usage and Improve application responsiveness
     by optimizing garbage collection process.

HOW IT WORKS:

GIGC uses a more efficient generation approach to garbage
collection.
It identifies and collects garbage faster, leading to lower
footprint and faster application execution.

NOTE: This features works automatically and requires no
      specific code changes from developers.
