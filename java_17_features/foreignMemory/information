Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview):

WHAT: Enables Java applications to interact with native
      code and memory outside the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

WHY: Improve performance and interoperability with existing
     c/c++ libraries or hardware resources.


HOW IT WORKS:

Use JEP 419 APIS to define foreign functions and allocate
memory.
Invoke foreign functions from Java code and pass data
back and forth

NOTE: This is a preview feature and requires additional
      configuration and platform specific consideration.
